# File Permission Management in Linux

## Overview
This project involves updating file permissions for an organization’s research team within the `projects` directory to align with the required level of authorization, ensuring system security.

## Summary
I modified permissions to match the organization’s authorization requirements using `ls -la` to check permissions and `chmod` to update them for files and directories in the `projects` directory.
